            The Hidden Crisis: Understanding Farmer Suicides in India
          </h1>
          <p className="mt-4 text-md md:text-lg text-gray-300">
            Indiaâ€™s farmers feed over a billion people, yet many struggle to sustain themselves. Debt, climate uncertainty, and economic hardships push thousands to take their own lives each year. Despite their hard work, they remain marginalized, with limited access to resources, fair prices, and support systems.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3 text-md md:text-lg text-gray-300">
            The cycle of debt, lack of institutional support, and crop failures leave farmers in an endless struggle, making it difficult to break free from financial distress.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3 text-md md:text-lg text-gray-300">
            This analysis dives deep into decades of suicide data across Indian states, revealing trends, regional disparities, and socio-economic factors influencing these tragedies.
